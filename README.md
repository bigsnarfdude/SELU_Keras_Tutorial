[Self-Normalizing Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515)

```
This paper introduces new methods to significantly increase NN effectiveness using three design choices:

1. By using a new activation function called SELU. 
2. By using a new Dropout function called AlphaDropout (set to a default value around 0.1 for lecun_normal).
3. By using weight initialization technique (lecun_normal).

SNNs with more than 4 layers outperform both: RandomForest and SVM tools. SELUs with α = α01 and λ = λ01 and 
the proposed dropout technique and initialization strategy appear to outperform traditional RELU based NN/FFN.

NOTE: In the few experiments I have conducted, I have also observed a small bump in scores just changing the 
Dense Fully Connected layers using SELU/SSN.

#### Step #1

Take a look at the benchmark comparison to understand MLP-SELU

#### Step #2

Here is a comparison of final FC layer in RELU vs SELU
